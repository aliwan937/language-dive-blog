            <h2>「青と夏（あおとなつ）」 – 青春の痛みと輝き</h2>
            <p>“青と夏” (Ao to Natsu, “Blue and Summer”) is a song that captures the emotions of youth—love, loneliness, longing, and the fleeting nature of happiness. This section of the song in particular reflects on lost love, the pain of separation, and the desire to hold onto beautiful memories.</p>
            <p>Below is a breakdown of key parts of the song, with furigana for easier reading and comprehension.</p>

            <h3>1. A Lonely Sky and Unreachable Hopes</h3>
            <p>僕(ぼく)はいま 無口(むくち)な空(そら)に<br>“Right now, I speak to the silent sky.”</p>
            <p>The image of a quiet sky suggests loneliness, as if the protagonist is trying to communicate their emotions to something vast and indifferent.</p>
            <p>吐(は)き出(だ)した孤独(こどく)という名(な)の雲(くも)<br>“I exhaled a cloud called loneliness.”</p>
            <p>Loneliness takes the form of a cloud, a metaphor for bottled-up emotions being released into the world.</p>
            <p>その雲(くも)が雨(あめ)を降(ふ)らせて 虹(にじ)が出(で)る どうせ掴(つか)めないのに<br>“That cloud brings rain, and then a rainbow appears—though I know I can never reach it.”</p>
            <p>Even after pain (rain), beauty (a rainbow) appears, but it’s unreachable—symbolizing a love that is beautiful but out of grasp.</p>

            <p>Even with love, loneliness remains, suggesting that the protagonist still feels incomplete.</p>

            <p>A defense mechanism: rejecting love before it can bring more pain.</p>
            <p>さようならさえも 上手(うま)く言(い)えなそうだから<br>“Since I probably can’t even say goodbye properly…”</p>
            <p>Even parting words feel too difficult, showing emotional vulnerability.</p>
            <p>手(て)をふるかわりに 抱(だ)きしめてみたよ<br>“So instead of waving goodbye, I tried holding you.”</p>
            <p>Rather than letting go with words, there’s one last desperate embrace—a silent plea to keep the connection alive.</p>
