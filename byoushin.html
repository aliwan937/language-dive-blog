            <h2>秒針を噛む (Byoushin wo Kamu) - A Song About Suppressed Pain and Desperation</h2>
            <p>秒針を噛む by ずっと真夜中でいいのに。 (ZUTOMAYO) is a raw, emotional song that delves into themes of self-deception, emotional suppression, and unresolved pain. The lyrics paint a picture of a person trapped in an internal struggle—one who feels disconnected from reality, relationships, and even their own emotions.</p>
            <p>The title, 秒針を噛む (Biting the Second Hand), symbolizes a desperate attempt to stop time or escape from an unrelenting reality. The song captures the feeling of suffocation when one’s emotions are too overwhelming to express, yet too painful to ignore.</p>

            <h3>1. Living a Fake Life</h3>
            <p>「生活の偽造 いつも通り 通り過ぎて 1回言った「わかった」戻らない」<br>“A fabricated life, passing by as usual. I said ‘I understand’ once, and there’s no turning back.”</p>
            <p>The opening lines suggest a life built on deception—perhaps towards others, or even towards oneself. The speaker is simply going through the motions, pretending everything is fine. The phrase 「わかった」戻らない (I said ‘I understand,’ and there’s no going back) hints at forced acceptance, where they comply without truly feeling at peace.</p>

            <h3>2. A Relationship Built on Lies</h3>
            <p>「確信犯でしょ? 夕食中に泣いた後 君は笑ってた」<br>“You did that on purpose, didn’t you? After crying during dinner, you laughed.”</p>
            <p>This line describes a toxic dynamic—one where emotions are being manipulated or ignored. The speaker feels like they are being toyed with, but they lack the courage to confront the situation.</p>
            <p>「「私もそうだよ」って 偽りの気持ち合算して 吐いて 黙って ずっと溜まってく」<br>”‘I feel the same way,’ you said, adding up these false feelings. Swallowing them, staying silent, they keep piling up.”</p>
            <p>This could represent a relationship where both parties pretend to be fine but are actually suffering inside. Instead of addressing real issues, they keep faking emotions, leading to emotional exhaustion.</p>

            <h3>3. The Weight of Unresolved Emotions</h3>
            <p>「何が何でも 面と向かって「さよなら」する資格もないまま 僕は」<br>“No matter what, I don’t even have the right to say ‘goodbye’ face to face.”</p>
            <p>The speaker feels powerless, as if they are not even worthy of a proper ending. This suggests a lingering, unresolved pain—perhaps from a breakup, a failed relationship, or a loss of identity.</p>
            <p>「灰に潜り 秒針を噛み 白昼夢の中で ガンガン砕いた でも壊れない 止まってくれない」<br>“I dive into the ashes, bite the second hand, smash it in a daydream—but it doesn’t break, it won’t stop.”</p>
            <p>The imagery here is intense. Diving into ashes suggests self-destruction or feeling reduced to nothing. Biting the second hand represents frustration at time’s relentless march forward. The speaker is trapped, desperately trying to break free from their pain, but nothing changes.</p>

            <h3>4. Wanting to Escape, Yet Still Longing for Connection</h3>
            <p>「このまま奪って 隠して 忘れたい 分かり合う○ 1つもなくても」<br>“Just take me away, hide me, let me forget—even if there’s nothing we understand about each other.”</p>
            <p>This expresses a desire to erase everything—to run away from reality, even if it means abandoning all emotional connections.</p>
            <p>「会って「ごめん」って返さないでね 形のない言葉は いらないから」<br>“Don’t apologize when we meet—I don’t need empty words.”</p>
            <p>The speaker rejects insincere apologies, perhaps because they’ve been hurt too many times before. Words without real emotion mean nothing to them anymore.</p>
