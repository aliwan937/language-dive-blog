            <h2>「きみの名前」 by 藤川千愛 — A Song About Redemption and Unbreakable Bonds in The Rising of the Shield Hero</h2>
            <p class="intro">*「きみの名前」* (*Your Name*) by **Chiai Fujikawa** is a deeply emotional song about despair, hope, and the power of connection. It follows a journey from **hopelessness and self-doubt** to **redemption and newfound strength**, all thanks to someone special — “you” (きみ, *kimi*). The lyrics explore themes of **loss, fear, trust, and perseverance**, showing how one person’s voice and presence can save another from darkness.</p>

            <h3>1. A World of Emptiness and Lost Hope</h3>
            <p>The song starts in a **state of emptiness**, where the protagonist feels detached from life and directionless:</p>
            <p>**「抜け殻みたいな空に 何を見ていた」**<br>*“What was I looking at in this empty sky?”*</p>
            <p>They don’t even know why they’re alive anymore:</p>
            <p>**「目覚めた理由ですら 分からなかった」**<br>*“I didn’t even know why I woke up.”*</p>
            <p>They are afraid to believe in anything because they’ve already **lost everything**:</p>
            <p>**「信じることに酷く怯えていた だってぜんぶ捨てたんだ」**<br>*“I was terribly afraid to believe. Because I had already thrown everything away.”*</p>
            <p>This suggests deep **pain, regret, or trauma** — perhaps from a personal failure, a broken relationship, or betrayal.</p>
            <p>The protagonist is so lost that they even **curse the world** and want it all to disappear:</p>
            <p>**「こんな世界ならもう 消えてしまえと 憎んでいたんだ」**<br>*“If this is the world, then let it disappear — I hated it.”*</p>
            <p>They are **desperate for something to believe in**, but doubt keeps holding them back:</p>
            <p>**「張り裂けそうだよ 信じても?」**<br>*“I feel like I’m going to burst… Can I believe again?”*</p>
            <p>This opening reflects **deep depression and distrust** — a feeling of being lost and hopeless.</p>

            <h3>2. The Voice That Saves Them</h3>
            <p>But then, something **changes** — the voice of “you” reaches them:</p>
            <p>**「ほら キミの声が 僕を救うよ」**<br>*“Look, your voice is saving me.”*</p>
            <p>This voice **calls them back to life, over and over**:</p>
            <p>**「何度も呼び覚ますよ」**<br>*“It awakens me again and again.”*</p>
            <p>This “voice” could be literal — someone offering support and love — or metaphorical, representing **memories, hope, or love** that they once abandoned.</p>
            <p>The protagonist finally remembers **what it means to feel connected and to love**:</p>
            <p>**「キミが教えてくれた想い そう なんどだって キミの名前を叫ぶよ」**<br>*“The feelings you taught me… Yes, I’ll call your name again and again.”*</p>
            <p>Gripping this person’s hand, they make a **promise never to let go again**:</p>
            <p>**「強くその手を握って もう離さない決して」**<br>*“I’ll hold your hand tightly and never let go again.”*</p>
            <p>They declare that **no matter what the future holds, they will not run away anymore** — as long as they are together.</p>

            <h3>3. Regret and Facing the Past</h3>
            <p>The next verse reflects on **past mistakes and broken promises**:</p>
            <p>**「守れなかった約束 噛みしめては」**<br>*“I keep chewing on the promises I couldn’t keep.”*</p>
            <p>They have tried to **bury their guilt and pain by doubting everything**, but in the process, they have also lost themselves:</p>
            <p>**「疑うことで 自分誤魔化してた」**<br>*“By doubting, I was just deceiving myself.”*</p>
            <p>They have **cried so much that they feel empty**:</p>
            <p>**「涙ももう 枯れ果てて」**<br>*“Even my tears have dried up.”*</p>
            <p>The protagonist is **trapped in a cycle of pain**, drowning in the same bad dreams over and over:</p>
            <p>**「繰り返される悪い 夢に溺れて 迷い込んだまま 見失いそうだよ」**<br>*“I’m drowning in the same bad dreams, lost and unable to find my way.”*</p>
            <p>It’s a **never-ending nightmare of regret and self-hatred**, and they feel like they are on the verge of losing themselves completely.</p>

            <h3>4. Light and Hope in the Darkness</h3>
            <p>But just when they are about to be consumed by despair, the person they love becomes their guiding light:</p>
            <p>**「そう キミの歌が 夜明けのように じんわり光をくれた」**<br>*“Yes, your song gave me light, like the dawn.”*</p>
            <p>Their heart, which had been closed off for so long, finally **feels a small but real hope**:</p>
            <p>**「塞ぎこんだ胸の奥に ちっぽけだけれど 確かな希望」**<br>*“Inside my shut-off heart, there’s a small but certain hope.”*</p>
            <p>This newfound **hope** is what allows them to move forward **without fear**:</p>
            <p>**「もう迷わない 二度と どんな未来も キミとなら逃げない」**<br>*“I won’t hesitate anymore. No matter what future awaits, I won’t run away if I’m with you.”*</p>
            <p>This marks the **turning point** — where despair gives way to **courage**.</p>

            <h3>5. An Eternal Bond</h3>
            <p>By the final chorus, the protagonist has fully embraced this person as their anchor:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>No matter where they are, they will keep calling their name.</li>
            <li>Even if their voice **goes hoarse, they will keep shouting**.</li>
            <li>They have seen a **rainbow before sunrise** — a symbol of **hope after suffering**.</li>
            <li>In a world without lies, they want to **give more and more love**.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The song ends with the **ultimate declaration of love, gratitude, and devotion**:</p>
            <p>**「ほら キミの声が 僕を救うよ」**<br>*“Look, your voice is saving me.”*</p>
            <p>**「どんな未来も キミとなら逃げない」**<br>*“No matter what future awaits, I won’t run away if I’m with you.”*</p>
            <p>This **final repetition** emphasizes that the protagonist has truly changed. They **no longer hate the world, no longer want to disappear**, because they have something worth living for — someone worth believing in.</p>
