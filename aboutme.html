            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I graduated from UCLA with a degree in Linguistics. As a heritage Chinese speaker who also studied abroad in Japan, I have a deep appreciation for the beauty and complexity of language and culture. Through this blog, I hope to share the hidden meanings and emotional depth of songs from these rich linguistic traditions.

                Music has always been a universal language for me, and I believe that songs carry stories, emotions, and cultural nuances that transcend borders. Join me as we dive into the lyrics of Chinese and Japanese songs, uncovering the poetry and meaning behind the words.
