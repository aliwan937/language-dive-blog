            <h2>Analysis of《刻在我心底的名字》 (Your Name Engraved Herein)</h2>
            <p>This song is filled with deep longing, unfulfilled love, and emotional struggle. It carries layers of hidden meaning that might not be immediately clear to an English-speaking audience. Below is a breakdown of the key themes and cultural nuances.</p>
            
            <section>
            <h3>1. The Meaning of “刻在我心底的名字”</h3>
            <p>(Your Name Engraved in My Heart)</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The phrase “刻在心底” (engraved in my heart) implies permanence and deep emotional attachment.</li>
                <li>Unlike English expressions like “etched in memory,” in Chinese, “engraving” suggests a love so profound that it is impossible to erase—almost like a scar that never fades.</li>
                <li>This metaphor hints at a love that has left an irreversible impact on the narrator.</li>
            </ul>
            </section>

            <h3>2. Struggle Between Love and Letting Go</h3>
            <blockquote>“Oublie-le 好幾次我告訴我自己”</blockquote>
            <p>(Forget it—many times, I’ve told myself)</p>
            <ul>
                <li>“Oublie-le” is French for “Forget it,” setting the tone of forced detachment.</li>
                <li>This immediately suggests a love that the narrator is trying—but failing—to let go of.</li>
                <li>It introduces inner conflict: the rational mind says to move on, but the heart refuses.</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>“越想努力趕上光的影 / 越無法抽離 而已”</blockquote>
            <p>(The more I try to catch up to the shadow of light / The harder it is to break free, that’s all)</p>
            <ul></ul>
                <li>“光的影” (the shadow of light) is a paradox—it represents something intangible, unreachable.</li>
                <li>The more the narrator tries to hold onto love, the further it slips away.</li>
                <li>This hints at a love that was never meant to last—perhaps due to circumstances beyond their control.</li>
            </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
            <h3>3. Unspoken Love and Regret</h3>
            <blockquote>“Je t’aimais 刻骨銘心只有我自己”</blockquote>
            <p>(I loved you—deeply engraved, but only within me)</p>
            <ul>
                <li>“Je t’aimais” is French for “I loved you.”</li>
                <li>The past tense (“aimais”) suggests that the love is now one-sided or in the past.</li>
                <li>“刻骨銘心” (engraved in my bones and heart) is a Chinese idiom for an unforgettable, life-altering love.</li>
                <li>However, the second half “只有我自己” (only within me) hints at unrequited love—perhaps the other person never reciprocated the same depth of feeling.</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>“好不容易交出真心的勇氣 / 你沉默的回應 是善意”</blockquote>
            <p>(It took so much courage to give you my true heart / Your silent response was kindness)</p>
            <ul>
                <li>This suggests that the narrator confessed their love, but the response was silence—not rejection, but not acceptance either.</li>
                <li>In Chinese culture, silence can be a way of expressing gentle refusal or avoiding confrontation.</li>
                <li>The phrase “是善意” (was kindness) implies that the other person didn’t want to hurt the narrator, but still could not return their love.</li>
            </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
            <h3>4. Love as a Lifetime Commitment</h3>
            <blockquote>“刻在我心底的名字 / 忘記了時間這回事”</blockquote>
            <p>(Your name engraved in my heart / I forgot that time exists)</p>
            <ul>
                <li>This suggests timeless love, where the passage of time does not fade their feelings.</li>
                <li>The phrase “forgetting time” reflects how deep emotions can make moments feel eternal.</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>“於是謊言說了一次就一輩子”</blockquote>
            <p>(So a lie, spoken once, lasts a lifetime)</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What is this “lie”?</li>
                <li>It could be the false hope that love was mutual.</li>
                <li>It could be the lie of saying “I’m okay” when they are not.</li>
                <li>It could be promises of forever that were broken.</li>
                <li>This line suggests betrayal, self-deception, or unfulfilled promises.</li>
            </ul>
            </section>

            <h3>5. Resistance and Loss</h3>
            <blockquote>“曾頑固跟世界對峙 / 覺得連呼吸都是奢侈”</blockquote>
            <p>(I once stubbornly stood against the world / Feeling that even breathing was a luxury)</p>
            <ul>
                <li>“對峙” (confronting the world) suggests fighting against societal expectations.</li>
                <li>This line hints at a forbidden or impossible love, possibly due to external pressures.</li>
                <li>The struggle is so intense that even “breathing” feels like a luxury—a poetic way of describing emotional suffocation.</li>
            </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
            <h3>6. The City as a Symbol of Loneliness</h3>
            <blockquote>“我住在霓虹的城市 / 握著飛向天堂的地址”</blockquote>
            <p>(I live in a neon-lit city / Holding an address that leads to heaven)</p>
            <ul>
                <li>“霓虹的城市” (neon-lit city) evokes imagery of modern life—busy, bright, yet emotionally empty.</li>
                <li>The address to heaven might symbolize:</li>
                <ul>
                <li>A dream of a perfect world (but unreachable).</li>
                <li>A desire to escape from pain (possibly even suicidal thoughts).</li>
                <li>A love that has already “died”, as if heaven is where it now resides.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>“你可以翱翔 可是我只能停滯”</blockquote>
            <p>(You can soar, but I can only stay still.)</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The contrast between one person soaring and the other being stuck suggests:</li>
                <li>One has moved on, while the other is trapped in the past.</li>
                <li>The narrator feels left behind, powerless to move forward.</li>
            </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
            <h3>7. The Final Acceptance</h3>
            <blockquote>“如果有下次 我會再愛一次”</blockquote>
            <p>(If there’s a next time, I will love again.)</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Despite the pain, the narrator expresses a willingness to love again.</li>
                <li>This doesn’t necessarily mean reconciliation, but rather an acceptance that their love was real and worth experiencing.</li>
                <li>It echoes the idea that even if love ends in heartbreak, it was still meaningful.</li>
            </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
            <h3>Final Thoughts: A Song About Forbidden Love and Loss</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The melancholic tone and poetic imagery suggest that this is more than just a breakup song.</li>
                <li>Many interpret this as a song about LGBTQ+ love in a society that does not fully accept it—hence the themes of hiding, struggling, and longing.</li>
                <li>Whether interpreted as unrequited love, lost love, or a love that was never allowed to flourish, the song resonates deeply because of its universal themes of pain, regret, and hope.</li>
            </ul>
