            <h2>Japanese Viral 檸檬 (Lemon) by 米津玄師 (Kenshi Yonezu) - Hidden Meanings</h2>
            <p class="intro">The song 檸檬 (Lemon) by 米津玄師 (Kenshi Yonezu) is rich with poetic imagery and deeply personal emotions, making some of its nuances difficult for an English-speaking audience to fully grasp. Here are a few key elements with hidden meanings that might not be immediately apparent.</p>
            
            <section>
                <h3>1. The Symbolism of “Lemon”</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>In English, lemons are often associated with sourness or something undesirable (e.g., a “lemon” car is a defective one). However, in the song, the 苦いレモンの匂い (“the bitter scent of lemon”) represents lingering, bittersweet memories of a lost loved one.</li>
                    <li>The scent of lemon is vivid and difficult to forget, much like the pain of a lost love. It lingers even after time has passed, symbolizing how memories can remain strong despite attempts to move on.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>2. “戻らない幸せがあることを 最後にあなたが教えてくれた”</h3>
                <p>This line means “You were the one who taught me that there are happinesses that can never return.”</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It suggests that the singer has lost someone — either through death or separation — and that their happiness with this person is irretrievable.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>3. “雨が降り止むまでは帰れない” (I can’t go home until the rain stops)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rain often symbolizes sadness, grief, or a period of mourning in Japanese literature and music.</li>
                    <li>The phrase implies that the singer is trapped in their sorrow, unable to move on until their emotional storm has passed.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>4. “切り分けた果実の片方の様に” (Like one half of a sliced fruit)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>This imagery suggests that the singer and their lost loved one were once a whole, like two halves of a fruit, but are now separated.</li>
                    <li>The idea of a “cut fruit” evokes a sense of incompleteness, symbolizing how they feel broken or unwhole without the other person.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>5. “あなたがいなきゃ永遠に昏いまま” (Without you, it will forever remain dark)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>This line expresses the depth of the loss — the singer sees their lost loved one as their “light” and without them, life feels eternally dark.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>6. “わたしのことなどどうか忘れてください” (Please forget about me)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>This contradicts the earlier themes of longing, adding a layer of emotional complexity.</li>
                    <li>The singer doesn’t actually want to be forgotten but is expressing a selfless, painful wish — perhaps wanting the lost loved one to be at peace.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Cultural and Emotional Depth</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The song was originally written in response to Kenshi Yonezu’s own personal grief, rumored to be related to the loss of a close family member.</li>
                    <li>The lyrics capture the rawness of loss, regret, and an inability to let go — emotions that are universal but expressed with uniquely Japanese poetic sensitivity.</li>
                </ul>
